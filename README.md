# DogEmotionClassifier

This is a Dog Emotion Classifier model that predicts the emotions of dogs as happy, sad, angry, or relaxed. The model has been trained on a large dataset of dog images using deep learning techniques and is capable of accurately classifying emotions of dogs in real-time.

#API Usage
The model is available as a RESTful API that can be accessed using HTTP requests. The API accepts an image of a dog as input and returns the predicted emotion as output. The API endpoint for the Dog Emotion Classifier is: https://api.dogemotionclassifier.com/predict.

#Input
The API accepts an image of a dog in JPG, PNG, or GIF format as input. The image can be sent as a binary file in the request body or as a URL pointing to the image.

#Output
The API returns a JSON object containing the predicted emotion of the dog. The predicted emotion can be one of the following: "happy", "sad", "angry", or "relaxed".

#Example output:

#Model Architecture
The Dog Emotion Classifier model uses the MobileNet architecture for its deep learning model. MobileNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is optimized for mobile and embedded devices, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

#Why MobileNet over ResNet?
The decision to use MobileNet over ResNet was made based on the need to reduce resource requirements while maintaining high accuracy. MobileNet is designed to be efficient in terms of model size and computational complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with limited resources, such as mobile phones or edge devices. In contrast, ResNet is a much deeper and more complex architecture, which requires significantly more computational resources and memory. By using MobileNet, we are able to achieve comparable accuracy with less computational overhead, making it a better choice for our use case.

#Model Training
The Dog Emotion Classifier model was trained on a large dataset of labeled dog images. The dataset was collected from various sources and includes images of dogs in different breeds, ages, and emotional states. The images were preprocessed to resize them to a consistent size and normalize the pixel values. The dataset was then split into training, validation, and test sets for model training, validation, and evaluation respectively.

The model was trained using a deep learning framework and optimized for accuracy and efficiency. The training process involved feeding the images through the MobileNet architecture, extracting features, and using a softmax activation function to predict the emotions of the dogs. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a categorical cross-entropy loss function. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were tuned to optimize the model's performance.

#Conclusion
The Dog Emotion Classifier model is a lightweight and efficient model for predicting the emotions of dogs as happy, sad, angry, or relaxed. The model uses the MobileNet architecture to reduce resource requirements while maintaining high accuracy. The model is available as a RESTful API, making it easy to integrate into various applications and services.
